# Example Plugin
This project shows how to create a plugin containing extension functions. The
plugin will be dynamically loaded by Formula at runtime. To get Formula to
load the plugin, you must do one of two things:
* create a subdirectory named Plugins in the directory that Formula currently runs from
and place the DLL generated by this project in that directory
* set an environment variable named FORMULA\_PLUGINS\_PATH containing the name of the
directory where the DLL generated by this project resides.

The FORMULA\_PLUGINS\_PATH environment variable works like the Windows PATH variable in
that you can list multiple directories separated by ; and Formula will attempt to load
plugins from any DLLs it finds in those directories.
